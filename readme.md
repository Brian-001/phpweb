## Creating a pure php dashboard styled with Tailwind CSS

### Basics
>Install PHP using [<b>Laragon<b>](https://laragon.org/download/) and follow the prompts ~ if you are on Windows. <br><br>
>You can also use [<b>Homebrew</b>](https://brew.sh/) to install PHP if you are on Mac or Linux <br><br>
>Install Database Management Tool such as [<b>TablePlus</b>](https://tableplus.com/). I highly recommend since it has a very awesome features including very nice GUI.<br><br>
>If you are using <b>Vs Code</b> you can install an extension called <b> PHP Server</b> to help you serve the project easily.

#### Once done, you are free to start your project and <b>Congrats!</b>.

#### Visit [<b>TailwindcssUiComponents</b>](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/application-shells/stacked) and copy the basic HTML code for the dashboard. 
#### You can use Tailwind CDN link or install it. Again, it's a personal preference.

#### Seperate repetitive files and organise them in a folder such as <b>Partials<b> and use require to call them in the views. These files may include nav file, header file, footer file etc
#### Organise "HTML like" files in a folder let's say <b>views</b>
#### All these ensures there is minimal duplication and you stick into <b>DRY Principle</b>
